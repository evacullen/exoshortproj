IMPORTANT:
- Put ALL FITS files into 'fits_files' and COPY YOUR PATH for "Directory with FITS files" in config.
- Copy path to 'output' for "Directory to Save Plots" in config.

- ALL planetary_parameters need to be updated in config (for TOI).
- Target Star X & Y Pixel (center) needs to be updated. So does Comparison Star(s) X & Y Pixel. This helps the code make sure its aligned w the image.

- In solve_astrometry replace 'ast.api_key' with your API key from nova.astrometry.net (or use mine, it's fine)

ALSO MAKE SURE TO: 
- Clean 'output' and 'fits_files' folder prior to use
